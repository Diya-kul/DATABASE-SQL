You are given two sets.
Set A = {1,2,3,4,5,6}
Set B = {2,3,4,5,6,7,8}

Only enter the correct integer in the editor below. Do not include any extra spaces, tabs or newlines.

SOLUTION:-
8

EXPLANATION:-
Union of set A and B ( A U B ) is all unique elements from both sets A and B, resulting in a set containing elements that are in A, B or both.
A = {1,2,3,4,5,6}
B = {2,3,4,5,6,7,8}
A U B = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8}, which is total 8 elements.
