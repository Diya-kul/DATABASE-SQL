PROBLEM:-
You are given two sets.
Set A = {1,2,3,4,5,6}
Set B = {2,3,4,5,6,7,8}

What is the total number of ordered pairs present in the Cartesian Product  ? Only enter the correct integer in the answering box. Do not include any extra spaces, tabs or newlines.

SOLUTION:-
42

EXPLANATION:-
The cartesian product of sets results in a set that includes collections of all ordered pairs.
no. of elemnts in set A = 6
no. of elements in set B = 7
Total no. of ordered pair = 6*7 = 42
