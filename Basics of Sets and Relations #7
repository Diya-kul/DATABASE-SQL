PROBLEM:-
Consider the following data table named Student.

Student Name        Number  Sex  
Nina                3412    F 
Mike                1234    M  
Nelson              2341    F  
Here is another data table named Teaching Assistants

Subject     ID
Physics     3412
Chemistry   1111
Mathematics 2341  
What is the count of rows returned in the following join operation?
Student ⊳⊲(Number=ID) Teaching Assistants

Only enter a single integer. Do not include any extra spaces or newlines.

SOLUTION:-
2

EXPLANATION:-
Because only Number = ID matches are:
                            3412 (Nina ↔ Physics)
                            2341 (Nelson ↔ Mathematics)

So the join returns 2 rows.
